Modelling mortalilty risks for heart attack patients

Utilised formulae from metaanalyses of the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) Model to generate datapoints via Monte-Carlo simulations.
Simulated data was combined with existing data on behavioural factors of patients for risk predictions to increase healthcare efficiency through early-detection.

Modelling was done in R using the following models
Extreme Gradient Boosting
Random Forest
